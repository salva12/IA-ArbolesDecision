# What is this thing?

This is an application that implements the Decision Tree algorithm, specifically the C4.5 one.

# Why did you code this?

Because we are (or were, depending on when you read this) taking the Artifficial Intelligence subject in the Information Systems Engineering career in the Universidad Tecnológica Nacional in Argentina. This is the _trabajo práctico integrador_, and we want(ed) to pass it.

# Who are you?

- Escalante Salvador @salva12 (C4.5 algorithm and entropy/entropy ratio calculations)
- Garcia Emmanuel @egarcia1997 (all the React-related things and data input)
- Maidana Lucas @lucasmmaidana (decision tree at the end of the app)

# What do I need to run this thing?

1. Install Node.js.
2. Clone this.
3. `cd` to the cloned directory and `npm install`.
4. `npm start`.

# Which libraries are you using?

We use React and other things. Open `package.json` and check the dependencies.

# Notes

The platform used by our university to upload our homeworks has a size restriction. So, don't expect any Redux stores, react-router routing, fancy styled-components components, etc.
